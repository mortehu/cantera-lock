The program locks X11 screens

Why not use this program:

 * May be unsafe?  There may be ways to circumvent the keyboard grab

 * Requires that the user can read his own password hash through getpwent(),
   i.e. shadow passwords are unsupported

 * Contains lots of irrelevant code -- was forked off a game engine

Why use it:

 * You don't want to press enter when you've finished typing your password, and
   you don't want to be penalized for typos
 
 * You want to see for how long the screen has been locked

 * You wnat to see the clock
